# Who Counts as A Musician Oultine

20 Minute Paper, 10 minutes for discussion 
-- About ten pages worth of material

## Main Contestable Statement

This paper argues that the music community should work towards dispelling the myth of musicality and move towards a way of thinking about music perception and appreciation as a collection of related, though not unified processes.

## Outline

### Introduction

* Establish that people think of musicality as an internal resource
* Establish that with a few quotes
* Models are formalizations of the langauge we use
* Examples of how this is good
* Examples of how this is bad
* End with fact that this is going to take place no matter what

### History of Measuring

* Carl Seashore
* Litany of other tests
* Note that I have had personal experiences of people saying they were told not to do music bc of results
* Spirit of telelogy: GMSI 
* GMSI breakdown, explain latent variable modeling

### Modeling and Intelligence

* Desmonstrate how it is the same way of looking at intelligence
* Explain the math behind LVM
* This then results in the postive manifold 
* History here about positive manifold (kovacs and conway) 
* What IS g? 
* Give examples or language 
* talk about phineas gage 
* Double parallel to aural skills or any sort of music listening
* Double dissociation studies 

### Why This Is A Problem

* Musicality is music's own postive manifold 
* Treating it like something that is real is a problem-- WHY!
* We can go back to the binary (get the benefits of selling music ed as brain helper)
* Or start to be more precise with our langauge talking about this
* Can't be able to claim the benefits of music training without this number
* make clear why this is a catch 22
* Cite the meta study, where line is drawn in sand is important

### How do I think it should be solved? 

* Need to divorce idea of music performance and listening
* Everyone is an expert listener in x,y,z
* Why theorists or ivovry might fall trap to Lerdhal and Jackendoff
* Teaching someone to hear, what is the point of it all? 
* Want to catch the details in it?
* Or is the point to have context, and does that context matter (margulis)

### More Points

* Cite own work on Wagner and listening
* Cite other research that says that there is too much on performance 
* Make sure to include Eric Clarke stuff that is relevant

### Want People to walk away thinking

* Better understanding of math behind LVM 
* That we shouldn't think of musicality this way
* They want to participate in conversation of modeling
