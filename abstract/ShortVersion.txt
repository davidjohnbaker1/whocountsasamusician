In the almost 100 years since Carl Seashore first published his Tests of Musical Ability, the logic behind measuring musicality has become more sophisticated, but the goal has remained the same: assign a number to something we believes exists, but canâ€™t measure directly. These numbers often serve as an approximation for when people make statements like 'She is more musical than him' and modeling musicality mathematically is essentially just a formalization of these intuitions. The problem is that the idea of musicality as some sort of internal resource that people have falls apart when it becomes dissected. 
This paper investigates the idea of measuring musicality by surveying its history, current state, and goals. Parallels are made to current work in intelligence research and this paper suggests that music psychology may not only face similar problems in terms of treating musicality as a monolithic internal resource, but the idea of doing so actually harms the research, as well as the general public in terms of audience accessibility. This paper argues that the music community should work towards dispelling the myth of musicality and move towards thinking about music perception and appreciation as a collection of related, though not unified processes. Drawing on work inspired by thinking in the cognitive sciences, this paper demonstrates that conceptualizing the multiple aspects of musicality in a modular way benefits both the research community and general public.
